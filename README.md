FollowApp is an analytics backed, cloud-based technology solution to remind and follow up with underprivileged mothers living in slums for their children's critical immunizations. FollowApp not only disseminates information to create awareness but also gathers critical data such as the vaccination status of the children for all diseases. FollowApp today has 4000+ benefactors, caters to 3 different does and 7 different vaccines, and we are now looking to expand to other healthcare areas as well. 

followapp-utils contains the analytics scripts, data insertion and call flow Id setup steps, alongwith other miscellaneous supporting docs.

More details coming soon.
